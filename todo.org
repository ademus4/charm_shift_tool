* Notes
- Intensity can be gathered from SEC 1
- The BPM and MWPC show beam profile with mean and FWHM
- SEC 2 is affected too much by objects in the beamline and is therefore not used
- Check data every 10 minutes.
- In order to know how long the beam has been down, store the time that downtime was
  detected
